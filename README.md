# Lab-3
**Project Overview**
This is a simple React application built using Vite that displays a 5x5 grid of clickable colour boxes. Each box changes its colour randomly when clicked. The project demonstrates the use of React components, state management, and basic event handling.

**Features:**
ColorBox Component: A reusable React component that accepts a colour prop and displays a coloured box. Each box is clickable, and clicking changes the box's colour randomly.

ColorBoxesContainer Component: A container component that renders a 5x5 grid (25 boxes in total) of ColorBox components. The initial colours are imported from a JavaScript file (data.js), where they are stored as an array of hexadecimal colour strings.

Random Color Change: Clicking on any colour box triggers a random colour change.
